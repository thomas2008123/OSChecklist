# ✅ Activity B Checklist
## 1. Visual / Interface Designs

 - [ ] For each design, create a complete user interface

 - [ ] Include a clear demonstration of the user journey

 - [ ] Provide justification for the colour schemes used

 - [ ] Follow W3C accessibility guidelines (contrast, font size, ARIA, etc.)

 - [ ] State the front-end requirements

 - [ ] State the back-end requirements

 - [ ] Evaluate the security of the system (explain who manages security, not how it’s implemented)

## LOGO & Colour scheme
When producing the website logo use canva and go in depth to give it a meaning and have thought behind it and additionally when producing the colour scheme ensure that you base them around colours in the logo and give them a background meaning e.g. if the site is about the jungle use a green and earthy colour scheme

when doing the design in figma constantly ensure that you are checking the contrast and colours making sure they comply with WCAG
